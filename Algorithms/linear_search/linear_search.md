# Linear Search

Linear search is a O(n) search algorithm, which runs through every element in the list and stops and returns a Boolean if found or not.

We can return the index at which the target is found or -1 (convention) if not.

Since it runs through all the elements, it has

Least time - O(1) - if the element is in the first position (or the last).
Most time - O(n) - where n is the length of the list, if its in the last or first (depending on the entry point into the list.)
